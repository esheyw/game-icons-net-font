# game-icons.net Font

A module for foundryvtt providing a FontAwesome-like glyph font made from the [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net) collection, which is released under the [CC-BY-3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

## Usage

Like with FA, you would use this via `<i>`s (or any element really) with specific css classes, in this case the icon filename with a `ginf-` prefix. **Note**: There are over 4000 glyphs, and I have done zero correction yet. Ideally none is needed, but if a particular glyph is misaligned or needs padding or something, I'll try and figure out how to do that, so make issues if things look weird.

## SVGs

Also contains the full game-icons.net collection as individual svgs (black stroke on transparent background only). I'm not 100% sold on this, nor on shipping all the compatiblity fonts (I'll probably remove the IE ones as soon as I can be bothered to alter the generated CSS after the fact...). Please do share opinions on this either in issues here or on discord.
